# Installation Instructions

First of all, run this command -> sudo chmod 777 deploy* setup configureFirewall

After that run this command -> ./setup

./setup command will run each deployment bash scripts to install the complete system.

Install the system in a clean docker installation, otherwise if there is an existing mysql container, the script will fail.
